      "developer": "I'm Derek Kaleida aka Dirly the developer of Against Great Darkness. I've been tinkering with game development for the last 7 years. I've always had a passion for games and found myself making prototype after prototype. I had always dreamed about releasing one. Hitreg Studios is a company I founded to pursue that dream. I wanted to show my kids that no matter who you are or what age you are it is not to late to follow them!",
